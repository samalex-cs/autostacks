Volkswagen is evaluating the market response before considering local assembly.\n\nGlobally, the ID.4 is available with two battery options: a 52 kWh pack with 275 km range and a 77 kWh pack offering up to 520 km. India will likely get the larger battery variant to justify the premium pricing.\n\nThe ID.4 features a spacious interior thanks to the MEB platform, a 12-inch touchscreen, augmented reality head-up display, and comprehensive safety features. Performance from the rear motor stands at 204 bhp.\n\nExpected pricing for the ID.4 in India is around Rs 50-60 lakh, positioning it against the upcoming BMW iX1 and Mercedes EQA. While expensive, the ID.4 offers a taste of global EV technology that's currently unavailable in India.",

The outright purchase option is priced at Rs 13.50 lakh.\n\nThe Windsor EV features a 38 kWh battery pack offering a range of 331 km. The interior is luxurious with aeroplane-style seats, a large panoramic sunroof, and premium upholstery. The 15.6-inch touchscreen with i-SMART connectivity is another highlight.\n\nMG reports that 60% of Windsor EV customers opted for the BaaS model, indicating strong acceptance of the subscription approach to EV ownership. Most customers are first-time EV buyers upgrading from ICE vehicles.\n\nThe success of the Windsor EV is expected to influence other manufacturers to explore similar ownership models to make EVs more accessible to the mass market.",

      "content": "The fourth-generation Maruti Swift has arrived with significant changes over the outgoing model. Here's a comprehensive comparison of what's new and what's changed.\n\n**Design**: The new Swift features a completely fresh design with sharper LED headlamps, a new grille, and a more dynamic stance. The side profile gets a floating roof effect with blacked-out C-pillars. The rear features connected LED taillamps.\n\n**Dimensions**: The new Swift is slightly shorter but wider than before. Wheelbase remains similar at 2,450mm, ensuring similar cabin space.\n\n**Engine**: The new 1.2-liter Z-Series engine replaces the K-Series unit. While power drops from 90 to 82 bhp, fuel efficiency improves significantly to 25 km/l (up from 22 km/l).\n\n**Features**: The new model gets a larger 9-inch touchscreen (up from 7 inches), wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, cruise control, and automatic headlamps. Wireless charging is a new addition.\n\n**Safety**: The biggest improvement is in safety. All variants now get 6 airbags as standard, along with ESP and hill hold. The previous model had only 2 airbags in base variants.\n\n**Price**: Prices have increased by Rs 40,000-60,000 across variants, but the added features and safety equipment justify the premium.",
